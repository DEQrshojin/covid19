\arguments{
  \item{df}{A data frame of countries and/or states with total confirmed and new daily Covid19 cases by date}
  \item{strD}{A date to start the movie frames from (e.g., '2020-03-01), if different from the JHU data (2020-01-22).}
  \item{dir}{A directory into which the movie frames (.png) will be saved}
